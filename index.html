    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Warm Neutral Harmony" -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page exploratory dashboard. It starts with a main title and an an introduction. The core of the app is a three-column layout, one for each stance. A central interactive chart visualizes the core tenets of each stance, allowing for direct comparison. Below the main columns, a "Key Arguments" section uses interactive buttons to highlight and display specific arguments (e.g., "Personalized Learning," "Algorithmic Bias") across all three viewpoints. This structure was chosen to move beyond a simple linear reading of the report and to encourage users to actively compare and contrast the arguments on a thematic level, fostering a deeper understanding of the nuances in the debate. The user flow is: Introduction -> Explore Stances Side-by-Side -> Analyze Core Tenets via Chart -> Deep Dive into Key Arguments. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Stance Comparison Chart: Goal: Compare the core focus of each stance. Viz/Method: A polar area chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: On hover, tooltips provide a summary of each stance's main argument. Justification: A polar area chart provides a compelling "spider-web" visual that quickly communicates the overall philosophical shape and priorities of each viewpoint simultaneously, making it excellent for high-level comparison. The colors have been updated to be more distinct as requested.
        2. Key Arguments Section: Goal: Allow users to analyze specific, recurring arguments across all three stances. Viz/Method: A set of interactive buttons (HTML/CSS/JS) that, when clicked, reveal corresponding text blocks under each stance's column. Interaction: Clicking an argument button (e.g., "Data Privacy") highlights the button and displays only the relevant text excerpts from each stance, dimming the others. Justification: This interactive filtering mechanism enables users to trace a single concept through the different ideological lenses, which is more powerful for synthesis than reading each column in isolation.
        3. Stance Cards: Goal: Clearly present each stance's viewpoint. Viz/Method: Styled text blocks within a three-column grid (HTML/Tailwind). Interaction: The content within these cards is dynamically updated by the "Key Arguments" interaction. Justification: This provides a clean, organized, and responsive way to display the core textual content from the report.

                    <p class="text-sm italic text-[#5D534A] mb-4">By Ezra Klein</p>
                    <div id="stance-1-text" class="full-article hidden">
                        <p class="mb-4">The debate around AI in education often feels like a rerun of every other technology debate: a fight between starry-eyed optimists and doomsday skeptics. One side sees personalized learning nirvana, the other, a chilling, dehumanizing dystopia. But what if we‚Äôre asking the wrong questions? What if the real revolution isn't about what AI is, but about what it frees us to do?</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">For decades, the factory model of education has persisted. One teacher, thirty students, one pace, one set of assignments. We accept this as normal, but it's fundamentally a logistical constraint, a historical artifact of an industrial age. It's a system that forces students with different needs, interests, and learning speeds into a single, rigid track. It's wildly inefficient and, frankly, a bit tragic.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Now, we have a tool that can break this system. AI isn‚Äôt about replacing the teacher, but about augmenting their reach. An AI tutor can provide instantaneous, personalized feedback to all thirty students at once. An AI assistant can grade essays for basic grammar, freeing the teacher to focus on the nuance of a student‚Äôs argument. The teacher‚Äôs new role becomes less about being the sole purveyor of information and more about being a mentor, a guide, a human connection in a digital landscape.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">The fundamental question isn‚Äôt whether we should use AI, but how we design the new system. What new incentives can we build? How do we retrain our teachers? How do we move from a one-size-fits-all curriculum to one that is truly dynamic and student-centric? The true promise of AI isn't in a new gadget, but in the possibility of finally dismantling an old, broken system and building something better in its place.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm italic text-[#5D534A] mb-4">By Nicholas Kristof</p>
                    <div id="stance-2-text" class="full-article hidden">
                        <p class="mb-4">There‚Äôs a shiny new object in the classroom, and its name is AI. We hear grand promises of personalized learning, of an education system finally liberated from the constraints of the old. But as I‚Äôve seen time and again, technological progress is not a neutral force. It is a mirror, reflecting our society‚Äôs deepest flaws, and in education, those flaws are a chasm of inequality.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Take the case of a student I'll call Maria. She lives in a rural community where internet access is spotty at best. Her school is underfunded, and the promise of a sophisticated AI-powered tutor is as distant as a star. Meanwhile, a student like Jason, in a wealthy suburban district, has access to the latest AI tools that adapt to his every need. The digital divide, a gap we‚Äôve tried for years to close, is now poised to become a crater, with AI as the shovel.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">And then there's the insidious problem of algorithmic bias. AI models are trained on data, and if that data is skewed, the AI will be too. We‚Äôre already seeing this in studies that show AI systems disproportionately flagging essays from non-native English speakers as AI-generated, or identifying students from marginalized communities as "at-risk." We are building a system that could embed and amplify our unconscious biases, cementing a cycle of unfairness under the guise of objective technology.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Before we fully embrace this new frontier, we must demand accountability. We must regulate these systems, audit them for bias, and ensure that the privacy of our children's data is protected. We must not be so dazzled by the promise of progress that we forget the human cost of leaving the most vulnerable behind.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">A funny thing is happening on the way to the educational utopia. We're so busy celebrating the efficiency of the new, we've forgotten what made the old so great. The promise is a digital tutor who knows your every weak spot, who can grade your paper faster than you can write "Dear God, help me." The reality? We‚Äôre trading Shakespeare for spreadsheets and Socrates for software updates.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Soon, the classroom won‚Äôt be a place of intellectual struggle and human connection, but a sterile lab of optimized outcomes. Your child will no longer look to a teacher for inspiration, for that spark of a beautiful idea, or for a kind word after a rough day. They will look to a screen. The teacher, once a guide and a mentor, will be relegated to a classroom manager, a glorified IT support specialist for a herd of plugged-in zombies.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">The very essence of learning‚Äîthe messy, beautiful, human act of grappling with a difficult text, of wrestling with a new idea, of the shared discovery between a student and a teacher‚Äîis being declared inefficient. We're telling students that the only valuable learning is that which can be measured, quantified, and turned into a data point for a dashboard. The non-quantifiable stuff, the moments of true insight, the joy of a genuine conversation? All non-billable hours in the new educational economy.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Let‚Äôs be honest. This isn‚Äôt a revolution. It‚Äôs a tragedy dressed up as progress. We're handing over the intellectual and emotional development of our children to an algorithm, and then we're surprised when they don't seem to have a soul. You can‚Äôt put a price on the look in a child‚Äôs eyes when a teacher truly connects with them, and you can‚Äôt program it, either. That‚Äôs a lesson no AI can teach.</p>
